 ## DESCRIPSION

 
Project Overview: Wanderlust - Travel Listing Platform

This is a full-stack web application built using the Node.js/Express.js framework with MongoDB as the database, implementing a travel listing and review platform. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern and includes user authentication and authorization features.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication System
   
   - Secure login/signup functionality using Passport.js
   - Local authentication strategy implementation
   - Session management for persistent user login
   - Flash messages for user feedback
2. Listing Management
   
   - CRUD operations for travel listings
   - Each listing includes:
     - Title, description, price
     - Location and country information
     - Image display capability
     - Owner information
   - Protected routes requiring user authentication
3. Review System
   
   - Users can add reviews to listings
   - Rating system (1-5 scale)
   - Comment functionality
   - Review deletion capability
   - Reviews are associated with specific listings
Technical Implementation:

1. Backend Architecture:
   
   - Express.js server setup with RESTful routing
   - MongoDB integration using Mongoose ODM
   - Session handling with express-session
   - Method override for PUT/DELETE requests
   - Error handling middleware
2. Frontend Structure:
   
   - EJS templating engine with EJS-Mate
   - Bootstrap for responsive design
   - Custom CSS styling
   - Interactive forms with client-side validation
   - Flash messages for user interaction feedback
3. Database Design:
   
   - Mongoose schemas for Users, Listings, and Reviews
   - Relationship management between models
   - Data validation at the schema level
Workflow:

1. User Journey:
   
   - Users can browse listings without authentication
   - Authentication required for creating/editing listings
   - Authenticated users can:
     - Create new listings
     - Edit/delete their listings
     - Add reviews to listings
     - Delete their reviews

3. Review System Flow:
   
   - Review submission with rating slider
   - Comment system integration
   - Review display on listing page
   - Delete functionality for reviews
Security Features:

- Password hashing through Passport.js
- Session security with HTTP-only cookies
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protected routes using middleware
- Error handling for unauthorized access
Development Considerations:

- Modular code structure for maintainability
- RESTful API conventions
- Middleware implementation for common functionalities
- Flash messages for user feedback
- Responsive design for multiple devices
This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of full-stack web development principles, incorporating user authentication, database management, and frontend design while maintaining security best practices and providing a smooth user experience.
